# *Report7: Extension by SSAKE*

## **Summary**

1. [x] Create cDBG with k=75 from the raw reads.
2. [ ] CD-HIT-EST the #1 cDBG with the **optimum** similarity threshold.
2. [ ] Extend the representative sequences from #2 using [SSAKE](https://github.com/bcgsc/SSAKE).
3. [ ] Get the longest from SSAKE write a new fasta file called ssake_after_75.
4. [ ] Compare the #3 fasta with the reprs from CDHIT clusters: Length of the two sequences and report the stats.
4. [ ] Create cDBG ssake_after_75 for the SSAKE reps.
5. [ ] Rerun #2 to 4 for one extra time, rename the output fasta into ssake_after_75_2.
